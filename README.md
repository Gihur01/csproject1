## About

This is a demo medical appointment system for a school CS project.
The system is made using Next.js, a full-stack react framework that can implement page routing as well as managing the backend.
The UI is built with MaterialUI, allowing it to look beautiful using MUI's components.
The database and authentication system is made using firestore.

This is a work in progress...
