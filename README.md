## About

This is a demo medical appointment system for a school CS project.

The system is made using Next.js, a full-stack react framework that can implement page routing as well as managing the backend.
The UI is built with MaterialUI using its react components
The database and authentication system is made using firestore.

## Current Features:
1. website only accessable if logged in
2. users can see their appointments in dashboard
3. users can add new appointments. They can only select times that haven't been booked yet.
4. see a list of doctor profiles.

Features yet to implement:
1. doctor's login and view their appointments
2. editing appointments (still buggy)
3. deleting appointments
4. view appointment history
5. notify users/doctor when an appointment changes.
